phs001593.v1.p1,Genome Sequencing of Familial Cholangiocarcinoma,"In this study, sequencing data (WES, WGS, linked-read WGS) was used to identify candidate causal germline variants in a family with inherited cholangiocarcinoma. Candidate causal SNVs and indels were identified  from the germline WES data of eight siblings (four affected, four unaffected), then somatic second hits were identified from matched tumor/normal",Cholangiocarcinoma,Family/Twin/Trios,"WGS, WXS","5 phenotype datasets, 20 variables, 11 samples sequenced, 8 subjects, 11 samples",NHGRI,"HMB-PUB-NPU --- Health/Medical/Biomedical (PUB, NPU)"
