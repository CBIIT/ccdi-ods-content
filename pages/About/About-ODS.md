# About the NCI Office of Data Sharing (ODS)

## ODS Mission

The mission of ODS is to create a comprehensive vision and strategy to enhance broad and equitable data sharing for NCI and the cancer research community at large. Data sharing is critical to foster collaboration, facilitate innovation, accelerate scientific discovery, and enhance rigor and reproducibility. ODS engages with many stakeholders within and across the cancer research community to guide interpretation and implementation of complex processes, programmatic initiatives, and policies needed to ensure impactful data sharing.

## ODS Responsibilities

***Leading NCI’s Efforts in Data Sharing.*** We’re leading NCI’s strategic vision and making certain that the approaches for managing, sharing, and accessing data adhere to the latest policies.

***Helping You Comply With Policies.*** We’re seeking new ways to help you comply with current policies, establishing and coordinating processes so data from NCI-supported studies are easy to access, share, and use.

***Supporting NCI Initiatives.*** We’re leading and guiding data-related NCI initiatives to help others share data with the wider research community.

***Fostering Collaboration.*** We’re working with others at NCI to ensure that data-related initiatives and data management processes meet the required federal policies.

***Serving as Advocates for Data Sharing.*** We’re making certain you’re up to date on the latest policies, tools, and resources you need to make your data available to the fuller cancer research community.
