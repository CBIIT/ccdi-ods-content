# NCI Public Access and Data Policy (PADS)

NCI seeks to create an infrastructure that enables researchers, clinicians, and patients to collaborate in sharing their collective data and knowledge about cancer to accelerate and improve cancer outcomes.

## Public Access and Data Sharing Plan Requirement

To maximize the availability of publications and the sharing of underlying primary data from NCI-supported research projects, applicants for extramural research funding (grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, Other Transaction Awards) related to the Cancer Moonshot are required to submit a Public Access and Data Sharing Plan.

The plan must (1) describe the proposed process for making resulting publications, and to the extent possible, the underlying primary data immediately and broadly available to the public; (2) if applicable, provide a justification explaining why such sharing is not possible.

## Elements of a Public Access and Data Sharing Plan

NCI understands the content of a Public Access and Data Sharing Plan will vary depending on factors such as the size and complexity of the data set. However, the plan should, at a minimum, address the following general elements:

- **Release of Publications:**
  - how publications will be made immediately available to the public
  - the methods through which the public, including other researchers, will locate and access the publication
  - any anticipated limitations to the immediate and broad release of publications, with an associated justification

- **Sharing of Underlying Primary Data:**
  - the type of data expected to be generated by the research
  - the data that will be shared
  - who will have access to the data
  - the timing and medium for immediate sharing of the data
  - the methods through which the public, including other researchers, will locate and access the data
  - any anticipated limitations to the immediate and broad sharing of data, with an associated justification

Underlying Primary Data should be made as widely and freely available as possible while safeguarding the privacy of participants, and protecting confidential and proprietary data.

## Guidance for Appropriate Public Access and Data Sharing Plans

Applicants have the flexibility to develop a Public Access and Data Sharing Plan that meets policy requirements. While not prescriptive, a compliant plan should include the following:

1. Publications must be deposited in PubMed Central with proper metadata tagging within four weeks of acceptance by a journal¹⁻². If the publisher cannot meet this timeline, authors should use the [NIH Manuscript Publishing System](https://www.nihms.nih.gov/login/?next=/submission/).

2. Publications should be published under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic License (CC BY 4.0) or a public domain license (e.g., CC0).

3. Publications should be made publicly available immediately, without any embargo period.

4. Underlying primary data must be available through an appropriate NIH/NCI data repository (e.g., [Genomic Data Commons](https://gdc.cancer.gov/), [dbGaP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/), [TCIA](http://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/)) or a non-NIH repository that conforms with the principles articulated in this Policy³.

5. When feasible, underlying primary data should be shared simultaneously with publications under an open-access license (CC BY 4.0 or similar).

6. The plan should outline how participant privacy and data confidentiality will be maintained, particularly for human subjects, as defined by 45 C.F.R. 46⁴. This includes de-identifying data per HHS and HIPAA regulations and ensuring controlled access to sensitive information⁵⁻⁶.

   - Before submitting the data, awardees will have their Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)⁷, privacy boards⁸, or equivalent bodies⁹ assess the informed consent materials to ensure compliance with this Policy for data sharing.

7. The plan should discuss any confidentiality concerns related to proprietary data and outline how they will be handled, ensuring broad access while protecting intellectual property rights.

In accordance with the NIH Public Access Policy, NCI will consider the following to be journals: (a) journals included in the journal section of the NLM catalog; (b) for policy purposes, manuscripts that meet the requirements for ISSN assignment, have content that is issued over time under a common title, are a collection of articles by different authors, and are intended to be published indefinitely; and (c) manuscripts determined to be journals upon review by NIHMS.
