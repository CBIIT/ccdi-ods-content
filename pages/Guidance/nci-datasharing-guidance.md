# NCI Data Sharing Guidance

If you're generating, collecting, leveraging, or managing NCI-funded research data, you'll need to stay up to date on the latest data sharing requirements.

NCI established the [Office of Data Sharing](https://datascience.cancer.gov/about/organization/office-data-sharing-ods) (ODS) to help you navigate these requirements. This team is your primary source for information on the policies and processes for sharing and using research data.

In short, when you have a question about how and when to share your NCI-funded research, ODS is here to help you. ([contact ODS](mailto:NCIOfficeofDataSharing@mail.nih.gov)).

**What is NCI's Overall Data Sharing Process?**

NCI's data sharing approach starts and ends with the patient in mind. So, what does this approach look like in its entirety? In this video, ODS Director [Dr. Jaime Guidry Auvil](https://datascience.cancer.gov/content/jaime-m-guidry-auvil-phd) will introduce all the stages of the data sharing lifecycle and share how she and ODS can help you navigate the various steps.

As mentioned in the video, ODS supports data sharing in three main ways. They:

- advise on programs that define impactful data and resources,
- implement policies that promote broad access and use of data, and
- offer tools and processes that help ensure data are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR).

*Data sharing begins and ends with the cancer patient. Through informed consent, the patient authorizes her data for use in research. In the center are the people using her data. This includes researchers and people working in funding agencies, institutions, and the technology fields. The gold ring shows ODS' role, supporting programs, processes, and policy needs. The outer ring shows steps in data sharing, starting with identifying research needs and approaches, and applying for funding (shown in purple); followed by generating, collecting, and submitting data (in mauve); accessing, using, and retaining data (in teal); and ending in better treatments and therapies for cancer patients.*

## Which Sharing Policies Apply to NCI-Funded Research?

Here's a sampling of data policies applicable to NCI-funded research. For additional policies on NIH data sharing, visit [NIH's Scientific Data Sharing website](https://sharing.nih.gov/other-sharing-policies).

### NIH Data Management and Sharing (DMS) Policy

- **Full Details**: [sharing.nih.gov](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/about-data-management-and-sharing-policies/data-management-and-sharing-policy-overview#after)
- **Effective**: January 25, 2023
- **Applicability**: New applications (Type 1) & competitive renewals (Type 2)
Competitive revisions (Type 3) & administrative supplements are not subject to the policy
  Not applicable to research & other activities that do not generate scientific data
- **Expectations**: Prospectively plan how to preserve & share scientific data
- **Sharing Timelines**: Share scientific data as soon as possible, but not later than the time of associated publication or end of performance period
- **Data Location(s)**: Repository appropriate for the data generated from the research project, or as in NOFO
- [DMS Policy FAQs](https://sharing.nih.gov/faqs#/data-management-and-sharing-policy.htm)

### NIH Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) Policy

- **Full Details**: [sharing.nih.gov](https://sharing.nih.gov/genomic-data-sharing-policy/about-genomic-data-sharing)
- **Effective**: January 25, 2015
- **Applicability**: New applications that generate large-scale genomic data & smaller-scale studies (of programmatic priority, or rare diseases)
  Thresholds & assay types clearly defined for meeting GDS
- **Expectations**: Include a genomic data sharing plan as part of DMS plan
- **Sharing Timelines**: Release lower-level primary data (L2/L3) by 9 months after data generation/QC
  Release summary analyses at publication or end of the project period
- **Data Location(s)**: NIH-designated data repositories
- [GDS Policy FAQs](https://sharing.nih.gov/faqs#/genomic-data-sharing-policy.htm)

### Cancer Moonshot<sup>SM</sup> Public Access and Data Sharing (PADS) Policy

- **Full Details**: [cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/grants-training/policies-process/nci-policies#:~:text=The%20NCI%20Cancer%20Moonshot%20Public%20Access%20and%20Data%20Sharing%20Policy)
- **Effective**: October 1, 2017
- **Applicability**: Cancer Moonshot research project NOFOs, contracts, and intramural projects generating Publications and Underlying Primary Data
- **Expectations**: Submit "Public Access and Data Sharing Plans" that describe proposed process for making publications and the underlying primary data immediately and broadly available to the public.
- **Sharing Timelines**: Immediately and broadly available
- **Data Location(s)**: an appropriate data repository such as the [Genomic Data Commons](https://gdc.cancer.gov/), [dbGaP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/), [TCIA](http://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/), or a [non-NIH repository](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/sharing-scientific-data/repositories-for-sharing-scientific-data) that conforms with the principles articulated in this Policy

### Dissemination of NIH-Funded Clinical Trial Information Policy
