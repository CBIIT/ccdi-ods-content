# NCI Expectations for Genomic Data Sharing (GDS Policy)

Investigators submitting their genomic research data to an NIH or NCI repository should review the following resources for information on the documents and processes.

## Examples of Projects That Fall Under GDS Policy

The GDS Policy applies to all NCI-funded research that generates large-scale human or non-human genomic data, as well as the use of these data for subsequent research. NCI may choose to apply the GDS Policy to projects generating smaller scale genomic data depending on the state of the science, the needs of the research community, and programmatic priorities. Investigators should consult with appropriate NCI Program Officers or Intramural Scientific Directors as early as possible in the genomic research planning process.

## General Guidelines for Large-Scale Research Projects

Regardless of study design, NCI requires sharing of large-scale genomics research data. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:

| **Type of Data** | **Data Examples** | **Number of Human Specimens (Including Human Cell Lines\*)** | **Number of Model Organisms, Non-human Cell Lines Infectious Organisms** |
|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SNP array data from > 500k single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPS) | GWAS Data | 1,000 | 500 |
| DNA or RNA sequence data from < 100 genes or regions of interest, or transcripts | Targeted Sequencing | 1,000 | 500 |
| DNA sequence data from â‰¥ 100 genes or regions of interest | - Targeted Sequencing<br>- Whole Exome Sequencing<br>- Whole Genome Sequencing | 100 | 50 |
| Genome-wide RNA sequencing data | Transcriptomic Data | 100 | 50 |
| Genome-wide DNA methylation data | Bisulfite Sequencing Data | 100 | 50 |
| Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data | - Transcription Factor ChIP-seq<br>- Histone Modification ChIP-seq | 100 | 50 |
| Metagenome (or microbiome) sequencing data | - 16S rRNA Sequencing<br>- Shotgun Metagenomics<br>- Whole-Genome Microbial Sequencing | 100 | 50 |
| Metatranscriptome sequencing data | - Microbial/Microbiome Transcriptomics | 100 | 50 |

*Includes distinct individuals, species, strains, samples, treatments, time points, tissues, single cells, etc. (*e.g., data from 25 patients at 4 time points after treatment would reach a 100-sample threshold; data from 50 tumors-normal comparisons would reach a 100-sample threshold*).

## Additional Projects Subject to GDS under NCI-Specific Priorities Regardless of Scale

Although the GDS is generally reserved for large-scale genomics, there are key points to consider regardless of scale. Investigators should consult with their appropriate Program Officers or Intramural Scientific Directors (SD) as early as possible to determine if they should submit small- or large-scale research projects.

Data may need to be submitted even for small-scale research projects depending on the:

- state of the science,
- programmatic priorities of NCI, and
- usefulness of the data for the research community.

Examples of small-scale projects that NCI would likely mandate data sharing for include, but are not limited to, projects:

- examining rare cancers, rare-cancer-related outcomes, or rare-cancer subtypes.
  - Check out the Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center for a [list of rare cancer summaries](https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/diseases-by-category/1/rare-cancers).
  - FDA: *A disease or condition affecting less than 200,000 persons in the United States ([Orphan Drug Act Pub L 97-414, as amended 1984](https://www.fda.gov/downloads/ForIndustry/DevelopingProductsforRareDiseasesConditions/HowtoapplyforOrphanProductDesignation/UCM517741.pdf)).*
  - [Rare Disease Act 2002](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/107/hr4013): *Rare diseases and disorders are those that affect small patient-populations (typically smaller than 200,000 individuals in the United States).*
- focusing on under-studied populations.
- relating to mitochondrial DNA sequencing.

Research that does not meet the above criteria and involves instrument calibration exercises and/or statistical or technical methods development is outside the scope of the GDS Policy.

**Please note that General Research Use without any further restricting modifiers allows the maximal benefit of research funded with public dollars and is preferred whenever possible and consistent with informed consent. If disease-specific data use or data-use modifiers are required, please contact the [NCI Office of Data Sharing](mailto:NCIOfficeofDataSharing@mail.nih.gov) for further guidance.

## The Data Management and Sharing (DMS) Policy vs. Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) Policy: Which One Applies to You?

[Text Description of Chart](#chart-description)  
![Decision Tree for GDS/DMS Policy Harmonization](https://cbiit.github.io/ccdi-ods-content/pages/images/custom/gds-dms-policy-harmonization-decision-tree.png)

### Chart Description

- Are you generating genomic data for your proposed project(s)?
  - If no, proceed to Question 2.
  - If yes, proceed to Question 3.

- Question 2: Are you generating or collecting [scientific data](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-21-013.html) (non-genomic) for your proposed project(s)?
  - If no, your projects do not generate scientific data. Neither the DMS nor the GDS Policy apply.
  - If yes, Follow the DMS Policy expectations as defined by your NOFOs/ICO policy/program. The GDS Policy does not apply.

- Question 3: Are your genomic data generated from human specimens?
  - If no, proceed to Question 4.
  - If yes, proceed to Question 5.

- Question 4: Does the data meet [NCI thresholds](https://datascience.cancer.gov/data-sharing/genomic-data-sharing/about-the-genomic-data-sharing-policy) for genomic data sharing for non-human specimens?
  - If no, follow the DMS Policy expectations as defined by your NOFOs/ICO policy/program.
  - If yes, follow the [GDS Policy expectations](https://sharing.nih.gov/genomic-data-sharing-policy/submitting-genomic-data/data-submission-and-release-expectations):
    - No Institutional Certification is required.
    - Full sequence data is not required.
    - Your data do not have to be submitted to NIH/NCI-supported repositories (e.g., dbGaP).

- Question 5: Does the data meet [NCI thresholds](https://datascience.cancer.gov/data-sharing/genomic-data-sharing/about-the-genomic-data-sharing-policy) for either genomic data sharing or rare-cancers/program priorities?
  - If no, follow DMS Policy expectations* as defined by your NOFOs/ICO policy/program.
  - If yes, follow the GDS Policy expectations:
    - [Provide your Institutional Certification by Just In Time](https://sharing.nih.gov/genomic-data-sharing-policy/institutional-certifications/completing-an-institutional-certification-form).
    - [Submit your data to NIH-supported repositories](https://sharing.nih.gov/genomic-data-sharing-policy/submitting-genomic-data/where-to-submit-genomic-data).
    - [Observe the data submission/sharing timelines](https://sharing.nih.gov/genomic-data-sharing-policy/institutional-certifications/completing-an-institutional-certification-form).

*You should consider protecting (i.e., de-identifying) participant information even if the genetic data are not required to be deposited into NIH/NCI repositories.
