# Access Data

When investigators submit their data to repositories, they allow others to build on their original discoveries and share insight through secondary data use. NCI and NIH offer multiple data repositories to ensure broad sharing of cancer research data from federally funded research.

## Open-Access Data

Investigators can use open-access data for secondary research without prior permission or authorization.

## Controlled-Access Data

In addition to open-access data sets, NCI facilitates requests to controlled-access data for NCI intramural staff scientists and extramural investigators. To use controlled data, you must obtain prior authorization through a Data Access Committee. NCI’s data access processes ensure that requests comply with NIH’s data sharing policies, and the data are used in ways that adhere to the consent given by research participants in their original studies.

***All users are expected to use the data responsibly.** [See Using Genomic Data Responsibly Under the NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy](https://grants.nih.gov/policy-and-compliance/policy-topics/sharing-policies/accessing-data/using-genomic-data)

### NCBI dbGaP Collections

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has established curated dbGaP Collections to facilitate access to controlled-access data and associated phenotypic data . Each collection groups datasets with similar consent-based data use limitations, enabling investigators to request access to multiple studies through a single dbGaP application. Access remains controlled and requires submission of a Data Access Request (DAR) and execution of a Data Use Certification (DUC) agreement to ensure appropriate protections for research participants.

- [NCI General Research Use (GRU) Collection (phs003014.v1.p1)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/collection.cgi?study_id=phs003014.v1.p1) – Includes individual-level datasets approved for general research use without additional restrictions beyond the DUC.
- [NCI Health/Medical/Biomedical (HMB) Collection (phs003044.v1.p1)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/collection.cgi?study_id=phs003044.v1.p1) – Includes datasets designated for research related to health/medical/biomedical purposes, does not include the study of population origins or ancestry.
- [NCI Cancer Research (DS-CA) Collection (phs003967.v1.p1)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/collection.cgi?study_id=phs003967.v1.p1) – Includes datasets approved for cancer-focused research use, subject to study-specific data use limitations.
- [NCI Pediatric and Adolescent & Young Adult (AYA) Collection (phs003964.v2.p2)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/collection.cgi?study_id=phs003964.v2.p2) – Includes datasets focused on pediatric and adolescent/young adult cancers. Individual datasets within this collection may have distinct consent-based data use limitations and must be used accordingly. Datasets may not be combined if such use is restricted by the applicable data use limitations.
