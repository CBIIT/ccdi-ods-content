# Access Data

> **&#10071; NOTICE:**  
> **We apologize for any temporary delays in processing NCI data access requests due to the recent federal government closure. We appreciate your patience as we work to restore normal operations as quickly as possible. Thank you for your understanding and continued collaboration in advancing cancer research.**

When investigators submit their data to repositories, they allow others to build on their original discoveries and share insight through secondary data use. NCI and NIH offer multiple data repositories to ensure broad sharing of cancer research data from federally funded research.

## Open-Access Data

Investigators can use open-access data for secondary research without prior permission or authorization.

## Registered/Managed-Access Data

Some repositories allow access to their data only if users are registered with the repository. In addition, the repository might monitor the usage.

## Controlled-Access Data

In addition to open-access data sets, NCI facilitates requests to controlled-access data for NCI intramural staff scientists and extramural investigators. To use controlled data, you must obtain prior authorization through a Data Access Committee. NCI’s data access processes ensure that requests comply with NIH’s data sharing policies, and the data are used in ways that adhere to the consent given by research participants in their original studies.

***All users are expected to use the data responsibly.** [See Using Genomic Data Responsibly Under the NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy](https://grants.nih.gov/policy-and-compliance/policy-topics/sharing-policies/accessing-data/using-genomic-data)
