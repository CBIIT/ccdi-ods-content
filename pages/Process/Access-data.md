# Access Cancer Data

When investigators submit their data to repositories, they allow others to build on their original discoveries and share insight through secondary data use. NCI and NIH offer multiple data repositories to ensure broad sharing of cancer research data from federally funded research. Cancer researchers and the participating community of patients and advocates can access data.
