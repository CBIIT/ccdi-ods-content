# Submit Data

Data sharing allows data generated from one research study to be used to answer questions beyond the original study. It reinforces open scientific inquiry, encourages diversity of analysis, supports studies on data collection methods and measurement, facilitates the education of new researchers, enables the exploration of topics not envisioned by the initial investigators, and permits the creation of new datasets when data from multiple sources are combined.

## Where to Submit Your Scientific Data

***Prior approval is required for submission to the CRDC. See [https://datacommons.cancer.gov/submit](https://datacommons.cancer.gov/submit) for more information.**

## Submitting Genomic Data

Submitting genomic research data enables translating research findings into knowledge, products, and procedures that improve human health. NCI supports and complies with all NIH data sharing policies which:

- Promote broad and robust sharing of human and non-human data from a wide range of genomic research
- Ensure appropriate protections for research involving human data and oversight of research conduct, data quality, data management, data sharing, and data use

Researchers submitting genomic data should refer to the data practices, file formats, resources, and processes:

- [Sharing Data: The Basics](https://datascience.cancer.gov/training/learn-data-science/share-data-basics)
- [Intramural and Extramural NCI Investigators](https://grants.nih.gov/policy-and-compliance/policy-topics/sharing-policies/gds/register-submit-study-dbgap)
- [Non-NCI Funded Studies](/post/Process/non-NIH-funded-study-submission)
