Looking for information on sharing NCI-funded cancer research data? This page details the people, policies, requirements, and resources you need to start sharing your data.

## How Does NCI Approach Data Sharing, Management, and Access?

If you’re generating, collecting, leveraging, or managing NCI-funded research data, you’ll need to stay up to date on the latestdata sharingrequirements.

NCI established theOffice of Data Sharing(ODS) to help you navigate these requirements. This team is your authoritative source for information on the policies and processes for sharing and using research data.

[Office of Data Sharing](https://datascience.cancer.gov/about/organization/office-data-sharing-ods)
ODS’ goal is to make complex NCI and NIH data policies easier to understand and to put into practice. ODS offers a broad range of expertise to help guide you through these policies.

In short, when you have a question about how to share your NCI-funded research, ODS is here to help you.

### What is NCI’s Overall Data Sharing Process?

NCI’s data sharing approach starts and ends with the patient in mind. So what does this approach look like in its entirety? In this video, ODS DirectorDr. Jaime Guidry Auvilwill introduce all the stages of the data sharing lifecycle and share how she and ODS can help you navigate the various steps.

[Dr. Jaime Guidry Auvil](https://datascience.cancer.gov/content/jaime-m-guidry-auvil-phd)


As mentioned in the video, ODS supports data sharing in three main ways. They:

- advise on programs that define impactful data and resources,
- implement policies that promote broad access and use of data, and
- offer tools and processes that help ensure data are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR).

If you’re working with NCI data and you’re uncertain about what to do or when to do it, we’re happy to help (contact ODS).

[contact ODS](mailto:NCIOfficeofDataSharing@mail.nih.gov)
Data sharingbegins and ends with the cancer patient. Through informed consent, the patient authorizes her data for use in research. In the center are the people using her data. This includes researchers and people working in funding agencies, institutions, and the technology fields. The gold ring shows ODS’ role, supporting programs, processes, and policy needs. The outer ring shows steps indata sharing, starting with identifying research needs and approaches, and applying for funding (shown in purple); followed by generating, collecting, and submitting data (in mauve); accessing, using, and retaining data (in teal); and ending in better treatments and therapies for cancer patients.

## What Are Some General Data Sharing Guidelines?

Now that you know more about ODS and the data sharing lifecycle, here are some guiding principles from ODS to help your data be most useful for secondary reuse:

- Designate data for “General Research Use” when you seek informed consent from research participants. This means others can use the data for research purposes only.
- Share your research. When you publish your research, include information on finding and accessing the underlying data (e.g., citations, URLs, and access instructions). Be sure to followNIH’s ruleson making your researchopen access.
- NCI and NIH data and public access policies outline expectations for making publicly funded information freely, broadly, and rapidly available to the research community. Consider publishing your findings in an open access journal.
- Use existing data standards wherever possible. You can share your data easier when those data adhere to FAIR data standards (i.e., data are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). Follow FAIR principles and use persistent identifiers (PIDs) for each data set, publication, and biospecimen.
- Adopt commondata elementsand data file formats, such as those from NCI’s flagship studies (e.g., PADS, The Cancer Imaging Archive, The Childhood Cancer Data Initiative, NCI-MATCH, and NCI’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program).

## Which Policies Apply to NCI-Funded Research?

Here’s a sampling of data policies applicable to NCI-funded research. For additional policies on NIH data sharing, visitNIH’s Scientific Data Sharing website.

[NIH’s Scientific Data Sharing website](https://sharing.nih.gov/other-sharing-policies)
NIH Data Management and Sharing (DMS) Policy

[NIH Data Management and Sharing (DMS) Policy](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/about-data-management-and-sharing-policies/data-management-and-sharing-policy-overview#after)
What is it?This overarching policy requires investigators to plan how data collected from any research conducted using funds from NIH will be responsibly managed and broadly shared with the research community. Visit theNIH Grants website for implementation details.

[NIH Grants website for implementation details](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-22-189.html)
How does it apply?If you’re seeking NIH funding, regardless of the funding amount or mechanism, you’re required to submit a DMS Plan. This includes:

- New grant applications (Type 1)
- Renewals (Type 2)

[Type 1](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/how-to-apply-application-guide/prepare-to-apply-and-register/type-of-applications.htm)
[Type 2](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/how-to-apply-application-guide/prepare-to-apply-and-register/type-of-applications.htm)
If you submitted a research application between October 1, 2003, and January 24, 2023, you should follow the2003 Data Sharing Policy.

[2003 Data Sharing Policy](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/about-data-management-and-sharing-policies/data-management-and-sharing-policy-overview#before)
NIH GenomicData Sharing(GDS) Policy

[NIH GenomicData Sharing(GDS) Policy](https://sharing.nih.gov/genomic-data-sharing-policy/about-genomic-data-sharing)


[check out our news article](https://datascience.cancer.gov/news-events/news/updates-nih-genomic-data-sharing-policy)
[read the notice](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-24-157.html)
What is it?This policy sets expectations for sharing NIH-funded genomic data broadly and equitably through asupported NIH repository.

[supported NIH repository](https://sharing.nih.gov/genomic-data-sharing-policy/submitting-genomic-data/where-to-submit-genomic-data)
How does it apply?It applies to all NIH-funded research (e.g., grants, contracts, intramural research, regardless of funding level) that generates or reuses genomic data from large-scale human or non-human research.

In addition, NCI may choose to apply this policy to projects that generate small-scale genomic data, such as those that:

- advance the state of the science.
- meet current programmatic priorities.
- add value to the research community.

Cancer MoonshotSMPublic Access andData Sharing(PADS) Policy

[Cancer MoonshotSMPublic Access andData Sharing(PADS) Policy](https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/moonshot-cancer-initiative/funding/public-access-policy)
What is it?This NCI policy sets expectations for Cancer Moonshot research projects to better collaborate and share their collective data. Under this policy, applicants submit “Public Access and Data Sharing Plans” that describe their proposed process for making, to the largest extent possible, publications and the underlying primary data immediately and broadly available to the public.
