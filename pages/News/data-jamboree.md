## Overview

To overcome barriers in finding, accessing, and utilizing cancer research data, the National Cancer Institute (NCI)'s Office of Data Sharing (ODS) launched its inaugural data jamboree on September 29 – 30, 2025, in conjunction with its 3rd Annual Symposium. In addition to promoting data utility for enhanced biological insights into cancer diagnosis and treatment, the event aimed to facilitate interdisciplinary collaborations, diversify the pool of data users, and gain real-time feedback on data resources and tools. The theme this year focused on pediatric, adolescents and young adult (AYA) cancers, a rare disease that faces tremendous challenges despite the generation and sharing of datasets by large-scale programs such as National Institutes of Health (NIH)'s Gabriela Miller Kids First Program and NCI's Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET), and Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI).

Through strategic planning, promotion and execution, the jamboree attracted over 120 participants from academia, industry, government, and non-profit organizations. Twenty-three interdisciplinary project teams formed to tackle specific problems in 6 broad project categories including enhancing data interoperability, building study cohorts, developing or validating informatics tools and pipelines, evaluating data quality and AI-readiness, and integrating and analyzing multi-omic and multi-modal data, as well as developing tutorials, tools, and educational materials. Eight project teams presented their results and outputs at the ODS symposium’s “Cancer Data In Action” session, demonstrating the tremendous value of sharing cancer data following the FAIR Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) with the broad community for novel biological insights.

## Data Jamboree Webinars

Beginning in January 2026, ODS kicked off a data jamboree public webinar series where teams dive deep into their project findings, lessons learned and future directions. To see past and future Data Jamboree Webinars, view the [ODS Webinars](/post/News/ods-webinars) page.

## 2025 Data Jamboree Projects

### Enabling Discovery in Rare Pediatric Brain Tumors Through Data Integration and Visualization

**Project Leads:** Diana Thomas and Gregory Wheeler, Nationwide Children's Hospital & Rakesh Khanna, National Cancer Institute

The project aims to reanalyze DNA methylation data files to harmonize classification of existing CNS tumors in CCDI MCI dataset and enable comparability, develop interactive data analysis platform allowing for dynamic cohort creation (e.g., OncoPrints, mutation heatmaps, survival analyses), and deploy standardized DNA methylation files and results through current data repositories.

&nbsp;

### CC-CARE-AI: A Framework for Assessing and Refining AI-Readiness of Childhood Cancer Cohorts from Kids First, TARGET, and CCDI

**Project Lead:** Yin Lu, ICF

The project aims to establish a modular scoring framework (CC-CARE-AI) to assess the AI-readiness of childhood cancer cohorts from Kids First, TARGET, and CCDI datasets. The framework will include scoring metrics for data completeness, linkage quality, format standardization, and clinical relevance across clinical, genomic, and imaging data. In addition, it aims to implement cohort refinement tools to help researchers optimize study design by balancing data richness and sample size, and include interactive dashboards and diagnostic reports to support decision-making and reproducibility.

&nbsp;

### Tutorial Materials for the Kids First Variant Workbench

**Project Lead:** David Higgins, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP)

The project aims to create additional training documents to explain what the Variant Workbench of the Kids First Data Resource Center is and how it can be used to support discoveries in pediatric cancer research. Create 1-3 example Jupyter notebooks that can be run by new users to demonstrate the capabilities of the Variant Workbench.

&nbsp;

### Survival Disparities among Children Diagnosed with Neuroblastoma Enrolled and Not Enrolled in COG Clinical Trials Using the NCCR Data Platform

**Project Lead:** Fernanda Silva Michels, North American Association of Central Cancer Registry (NAACCR)

The project aims to compare survival between children with neuroblastoma who did participate in a COG clinical trial with children with neuroblastoma who participate in a COG clinical trial. It has the potential to determine whether racial and ethnic disparities in survival among children with neuroblastoma extend to the population that did not participate in a COG clinical trial.

&nbsp;

### Developing an Oncology Knowledge Graph

**Project Lead:** Michael Watkins, University of Chicago (UC)

To address a lack of semantic infrastructure in oncology research, the project aims to leverage crowd-sourced concept mapping and development of a POC knowledge graph, create tools to curate semantic linkages across oncology terminologies, and ultimately create a demo that uses queries to augment a C3DC dataset with non-NCIt terminology mappings.

&nbsp;

### Exploring New Data Integration Approaches to Enhance Ontology-Based Pediatric Cancer Classification on Challenging Clinical Cases

**Project Lead:** Jinghui Zhang, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital

To solve challenging clinical cases that cannot be assigned to a diagnostic subtypes, this project aims to develop and apply RNA-seq and imaging data-based classifier to enhance the classification of such cases by improving the precision and/or confidence on 50% of the cases using 20 cases profiled by the Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI). This project may inspire future studies in systematically implementing these classifiers in clinical setting or for research studies that require integration of multiple data sets.

&nbsp;

### Proteogenomic Characterization of Childhood Ependymoma to Identify New Therapeutic Targets

**Project Lead:** Tung-Shing Mamie Lih, Johns Hopkins University

By integrating genomic and proteomic data sets from childhood ependymoma, the project aims to define molecular subtypes that can explain clinical heterogeneity of the disease, unravel mechanisms driving tumorigenesis and progression, and advance the discovery of druggable proteins or pathways that can match with existing or repurposable therapeutics.

&nbsp;

### Immune Characterization of Pediatric Soft Tissue Sarcomas (STS)

**Project Leads:** Sapna Oberoi, University of Manitoba; Nicolas Llosa, Johns Hopkins University; Jack F. Shern, NCI; Erin Rudzinski, Indiana University School of Medicine

The project aims to apply a transcriptomic-based immune classification (SIC A–E) to pediatric STS using bulk RNA-seq data from the CCDI MCI cohort, and describe the distribution of immune subtypes across histologies and infer tumor microenvironment profiles using multiple deconvolution algorithms, by integrating results with pathology review and clinical outcome data.

&nbsp;

### Integrative Genomic Analysis of Rare Cancer Data from the Pediatric MI-OncoSeq within the NCI Childhood Cancer Data Initiative

**Project Leads:** Marcin Cieslik, University of Michigan; Jamie Estill, University of Michigan

The project aims to develop informational materials to improve the presentation of Peds-MI-OncoSeq datasets in CCDI, improve technical documentation on the assay/technology/bioinformatics of Peds-MI-OncoSeq data, and ultimately characterize the multi-omic landscape of the Peds-MI-OncoSeq cohort to define the molecular architecture of pediatric malignancies. Write tutorial to link genetic, transcriptomic, and clinical data of Peds-MI-OncoSeq dataset in CCDI.
