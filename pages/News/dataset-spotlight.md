# Cancer Dataset Spotlights

Each month, the scientific community highlights various cancer subtypes to raise awareness for research and funding. Learn a bit about each and see a sample list of data sets NCI offers to researchers of these cancer subtypes!

## January

### Cervical Cancer Awareness Month

While Cervical cancer was once a leading cause of death for US women, it has been significantly reduced by screening and prevention efforts. Despite this progress, around 13,960 new cases and 4,310 deaths were projected in 2023. The cancer is primarily caused by HPV, making vaccines a crucial prevention method, alongside Pap tests for early detection and treatment. Pathogen-related, cervical cancer is part of a group including bacteria, viruses, and parasites that cause cancer. Recent studies highlight concerns for women over 65, as findings suggest late-stage discovery when past regular screenings. In low-income countries with sporadic screening, the disease often progresses unchecked to advanced stages. Vulnerable populations like Black, Hispanic, low-income, and rural communities face heightened risks, emphasizing the need to address disparities in cervical cancer care.

[NCI resources currently offers 9 Cervical Cancer related data sets](https://cbiit.github.io/ccdi-ods-content/pages/documents/data-spotlight-cancer-subtypes/Cervical.xlsx). Additionally, other data sets are also available which include Cervical Cancer data as part of larger studies encompassing many cancer subtypes.

## February

### Gallbladder and Bile Duct Cancer Awareness Month

Gallbladder cancer and bile duct cancer are rare forms of cancer affecting organs crucial for bile storage and transportation in the body. The gallbladder, positioned below the liver, stores bile, aiding in fat digestion, while bile ducts serve as thin tubes carrying bile from the liver to the gallbladder and small intestine. In 2023, approximately 12,220 individuals in the United States were diagnosed with gallbladder cancer, resulting in around 4,510 deaths. Bile duct cancer, including extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, affects roughly 8,000 Americans annually, with both types typically showing poor prognoses, even at early stages. Symptoms of these cancers include jaundice, abdominal pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, bloating, and abdominal lumps. Early detection and treatment are vital for improving outcomes in these aggressive cancers.

[NCI resources currently offers 8 Gallbladder and Bile Duct Cancer related data sets](https://cbiit.github.io/ccdi-ods-content/pages/documents/data-spotlight-cancer-subtypes/Gall_Bladder_Bile_Duct.csv).

### Brain Cancer Awareness Month

In 2024, approximately 25,400 people in the United States are expected to be diagnosed with cancers of the brain or central nervous system, constituting a portion of the over 94,000 brain tumors (including benign ones) projected for the year, according to the NCI. These tumors, arising from abnormal cell growth, can be benign or malignant. While benign tumors typically grow and press on nearby brain areas without spreading, malignant ones tend to grow rapidly and invade surrounding tissues. Both types can disrupt normal brain function, requiring treatment. Primary brain tumors originate in the brain and may rarely spread to other brain regions or the spine but seldom metastasize to other body parts. Conversely, metastatic brain tumors, originating elsewhere in the body and spreading to the brain, are more common, with around half arising from lung cancer. The estimated death toll from these cancers in 2024 is approximately 18,760, as reported by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program.

[NCI resources currently offers 33 Brain Cancer related data sets](https://cbiit.github.io/ccdi-ods-content/pages/documents/data-spotlight-cancer-subtypes/Brain.xlsx). Additionally, other data sets are also available which include Brain Cancer data as part of larger studies encompassing many cancer subtypes.

### Melanoma and Skin Cancer Awareness Month

Skin cancer encompasses melanoma, basal cell skin cancer, and squamous cell skin cancer, with over 5 million nonmelanoma cases diagnosed annually in the United States, primarily basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, which rarely metastasize. Melanoma, however, is aggressive, prone to invading nearby tissues and spreading to other body parts. In 2024, approximately 100,640 Americans are expected to receive a melanoma diagnosis, with around 8,290 deaths projected, according to estimates from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. Melanoma prevalence is higher in fair-skinned individuals and males, with risk factors including unusual moles, prolonged sunlight exposure, and personal health history. Additionally, melanoma may manifest on mucous membranes or ocular tissues.

[NCI resources currently offers 44 Melanoma and Skin Cancer related data sets](https://cbiit.github.io/ccdi-ods-content/pages/documents/data-spotlight-cancer-subtypes/Melanoma_and_Skin.xlsx). Additionally, other data sets are also available which include Melanoma and Skin Cancer data as part of larger studies encompassing many cancer subtypes.

## June

### Cancer Survivors Month

Thanks to the hard work of the cancer research and care community, outcomes for many cancers have improved with time, and as of today close to 19 million people in the United States are living having survived a cancer diagnosis. While this is a huge achievement, nearly 25% of those survivors are managing lingering effects of their disease and/or treatment, including impaired physical or mental quality of life and lasting financial burden. As we get better at treating cancers, it is paramount we begin to focus on the needs of survivors, ensuring the life they fought for is happy and fulfilling.

Survivorship in cancer encompasses a broad spectrum of concerns ranging from treatment efficacy to quality of life, spanning clinical, psychological, and social aspects. Defining a "cancer survivor" varies among organizations, however the National Cancer Instituteâ€™s Office of Cancer Survivorship defines survivors as individuals with cancer from the time of diagnosis and for the balance of life. There are many types of survivors, including those living with cancer and those free of cancer. This term is meant to capture a population of those with a history of cancer rather than to provide a label that may or may not resonate with individuals.

The increasing number of cancer survivors, now exceeding 18 million in the US, reflects improved detection and medical advancements. However, survivorship experiences vary widely, influencing physical, psychological, and social well-being, even long after diagnosis. This journey brings forth persistent concerns about health, recurrence, insurance coverage, and the impact of late effects from treatments. The cancer survivorship movement empowers patients to actively engage in treatment decisions, seeking education, support services, and partnerships with physicians for comprehensive care management.

Additionally, cancer survivorship disparities persist across gender, race, ethnicity, and socio-economic factors, affecting incidence, morbidity, and mortality. These disparities often stem from a blend of biological and social factors, including unique exposure to environmental agents, and challenges in accessing adequate care.

[NCI resources currently offers 4 survivorship related data sets](https://cbiit.github.io/ccdi-ods-content/pages/documents/data-spotlight-cancer-subtypes/Survivorship.xlsx).

## July

### Bone Cancer and Sarcomas Awareness Month

Soft tissue sarcomas develop in various tissues like cartilage, fat, muscle, blood vessels, tendons, nerves, and around joints, while osteosarcomas and Ewing sarcomas form in bones and soft tissues, and liposarcomas and rhabdomyosarcomas form in fat and muscle respectively. These cancers affect different age groups, with bone and joint cancer more common in teenagers and soft tissue cancers typically in those 55 or older. In 2024, an estimated 13,590 cases of soft tissue sarcoma and 3,970 cases of bone and joint cancer are expected in the U.S., leading to approximately 5,200 and 2,050 deaths, respectively. Five-year survival rates are about 66% for soft tissue sarcomas and 68% for bone and joint sarcomas. Sarcomas are often underdiagnosed as they can resemble other cancers. Risk factors include inherited disorders, past radiation therapy, exposure to certain chemicals, and conditions like retinoblastoma gene mutations, Paget disease, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and Werner syndrome.

[NCI resources currently offers 29 bone cancer and sarcoma related data sets](https://cbiit.github.io/ccdi-ods-content/pages/documents/data-spotlight-cancer-subtypes/Sarcomas.xlsx).

## September

### Childhood Cancer Awareness Month

In the United States, pediatric cancer affects approximately 1 in 260 children and adolescents annually, making it the leading cause of disease-related death in this age group. Although pediatric cancer remains relatively rare, advances in cancer research have led to a 70 percent reduction in cancer-related deaths among children (0-14 years old) and a 64 percent decrease among adolescents (15-19 years old) over the past 40 years. Despite these strides, an estimated 9,910 children and 5,280 adolescents are expected to receive cancer diagnoses in 2023, with approximately 1,040 children and 550 adolescents projected to lose their lives to these diseases, according to the American Cancer Society. The most prevalent pediatric cancers include acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), brain and central nervous system tumors, various lymphomas, and neuroblastoma, collectively constituting roughly half of new cases each year.

[NCI resources currently offer over 300 Pediatric Cancer focused data sets](https://cbiit.github.io/ccdi-ods-content/pages/documents/data-spotlight-cancer-subtypes/Pediatric.xlsx). Additionally, other data sets are also available which include Pediatric Cancer data as part of larger studies encompassing many cancer subtypes.

### Leukemia and Lymphoma Awareness Month

Leukemia and lymphoma are blood and bone marrow cancers. Leukemia originates in the blood-forming tissues and produces abnormal white blood cells that don't die when needed, potentially crowding out normal blood cells. In 2023, an estimated 59,610 new leukemia cases and 23,710 deaths are expected in the United States, with leukemia being the most common cancer in children under 15. The four major types are acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Lymphomas, on the other hand, start in lymph system cells and are categorized as Hodgkin lymphoma, marked by Reed-Sternberg cells in lymph nodes, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), which includes various cancers of immune system cells, with the most common types being diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. In 2023, it is estimated that 80,550 people in the United States will be diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, resulting in 20,180 deaths, and both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas can affect both children and adults.

[NCI resources currently offer over 160 Leukemia and Lymphoma focused data sets](https://cbiit.github.io/ccdi-ods-content/pages/documents/data-spotlight-cancer-subtypes/Leukemia_and_Lymphoma.xlsx).

### Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month

Ovarian cancer, encompassing cancers of the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and primary peritoneum, ranks as the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in people with female reproductive organs. Often detected at advanced stages due to a lack of early symptoms and challenging screening, ovarian cancer is relatively rare, affecting about 1.3% of people with female reproductive organs in their lifetime. In 2023, an estimated 19,710 people in the US will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer, resulting in 13,270 deaths. Unfortunately, the survival rate remains low, with a five-year relative survival rate of 50.8%. There are three adult ovarian cancer types: ovarian epithelial cancer, ovarian germ cell tumors, and ovarian low malignant potential tumors. Risk factors include family history, inherited gene mutations like BRCA1 and BRCA2, estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy, and fertility drug use.

[NCI resources currently offer over 30 Ovarian Cancer focused data sets](https://cbiit.github.io/ccdi-ods-content/pages/documents/data-spotlight-cancer-subtypes/Ovarian.xlsx). Additionally, other data sets are also available which include Ovarian Cancer data as part of larger studies encompassing many cancer subtypes.

### Prostate Cancer Awareness Month

Prostate cancer, the most common non-skin cancer in people with a prostate, ranks as the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among this group, following lung cancer. This cancer originates in the walnut-sized prostate gland, situated below the bladder and in front of the rectum, producing fluids for semen. Often asymptomatic in its early stages, prostate cancer may manifest as urinary symptoms in advanced cases. Effective screening allows for early detection, resulting in generally favorable survival rates. In 2023, the National Cancer Institute estimates over 868,300 new prostate cancer cases and 34,700 deaths in the United States. Risk factors include age, family history, race, smoking, obesity, and insufficient physical activity, with approximately 11 percent of people with a prostate experiencing this cancer during their lifetimes. Notably, Black Americans with a prostate have the highest prostate cancer death rate in the US, attributed to genetic and socioeconomic factors, with this group being twice as likely to die from the disease as white counterparts during the 2015-2019 period.

[NCI resources currently offer over 60 Prostate Cancer focused data sets](https://cbiit.github.io/ccdi-ods-content/pages/documents/data-spotlight-cancer-subtypes/Prostate.xlsx). Additionally, other data sets are also available which include Prostate Cancer data as part of larger studies encompassing many cancer subtypes.

### Thyroid Cancer Awareness Month

The thyroid, a butterfly-shaped gland in the throat, produces hormones controlling heart rate, body temperature, metabolism, and blood calcium levels using iodine. In 2023, the National Cancer Institute's SEER database predicts 43,720 thyroid cancer diagnoses in the US, resulting in 2,120 deaths, with a high five-year survival rate of 98.5 percent. Four main types exist: papillary (85% of cases, highly curable if caught early), follicular (10%, slow-growing and treatable when detected early), medullary (associated with a specific gene mutation and detectable through blood tests), and anaplastic (rare, aggressive, and challenging to treat, mostly affecting older individuals). Risk factors include radiation exposure, family history, and sex assigned at birth.

## October

### Breast Cancer Awareness Month

According to the National Cancer Institute, nearly 298,000 women in the United States will be diagnosed with breast cancer, and over 43,000 will die from it in 2023. Additionally, around 2,800 men are expected to be diagnosed with breast cancer, with 530 succumbing to the disease this year. Breast cancer is the most prevalent non-skin cancer among American women, constituting 15% of new cases and ranking second to lung cancer in cancer-related female deaths. It manifests in various forms, including ductal carcinoma, lobular carcinoma, and inflammatory breast cancer. Primary risk factors include being female, older age, estrogen levels, dense breast tissue, reproductive factors, hormone use for menopausal symptoms, smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity. Hereditary breast cancer accounts for 5-10% of cases, with certain gene mutations like BRCA1 and BRCA2 increasing the risk. Men can also develop breast cancer, albeit less commonly, and risk factors include radiation exposure, high estrogen levels, and a family history of the disease. Recent advancements include new targeted therapies for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, and in May 2023, updated guidelines recommended breast cancer screening for women every other year starting at age 40, a decade earlier than previous recommendations, aiming to save lives and improve outcomes.

[NCI resources currently offers 117 Breast Cancer focused data sets](https://cbiit.github.io/ccdi-ods-content/pages/documents/data-spotlight-cancer-subtypes/Breast.xlsx).

## November

### Carcinoid Cancer Awareness Month

Carcinoid tumors, uncommon and slow-growing, primarily emerge in the digestive tract and lungs but can occur elsewhere like the testes and ovaries. They belong to the neuroendocrine tumor category, originating from cells in the nervous and hormonal systems. Typically asymptomatic in early stages, they're often incidentally discovered during unrelated X-rays. Symptoms, when present, like facial flushing, diarrhea, abdominal pain, rash, and intestinal bleeding, aren't specific to this cancer. Usually diagnosed in individuals over 60, it's more common in women. Over 12,000 cases of carcinoid tumors are estimated annually in the US. Risk factors include a family history of certain syndromes like multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) or neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), and conditions affecting stomach acid production like atrophic gastritis or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.

[NCI resources currently offers 14 Carcinoid Cancer related data sets](https://cbiit.github.io/ccdi-ods-content/pages/documents/data-spotlight-cancer-subtypes/Carcinoid.xlsx). Additionally, other data sets are also available which include Carcinoid Cancer data as part of larger studies encompassing many cancer subtypes.

### Gastric Cancer Awareness Month

Gastric cancer, or stomach cancer, begins in the stomach lining's cells, gradually spreading through its layers. Around 90 percent of cases are adenocarcinomas, originating in mucus-secreting glands, while about 5 percent are lymphomas, from the immune system, and some are carcinoids, a slower-growing neuroendocrine type. Stromal tumors, arising in supporting tissues, require different treatment. In 2023, an estimated 26,500 new cases and 11,130 deaths from stomach cancer are predicted in the US by the National Cancer Institute's SEER Program. Men have higher diagnoses, and stomach cancer is less common in non-Hispanic whites. Risk factors encompass smoking, age, diet, and chronic stomach inflammation, such as Helicobacter pylori infection.

[NCI resources currently offer 9 Gastric Cancer focused data sets](https://cbiit.github.io/ccdi-ods-content/pages/documents/data-spotlight-cancer-subtypes/Gastric.xlsx). Additionally, other data sets are also available which include Gastric Cancer data as part of larger studies encompassing many cancer subtypes.

### Lung Cancer Awareness Month

Lung cancer stands as the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the US for both men and women, claiming more lives than other prominent cancer types combined. In 2023, the National Cancer Institute's SEER Program projects 238,340 diagnoses and 127,070 deaths from lung and bronchus cancer. Smoking remains the primary cause, while risk factors also include secondhand smoke exposure, family history, radiation therapy, and workplace exposure to various substances like asbestos and radon. Combined with smoking, these factors elevate the risk. Lung cancer comprises two main forms: small cell and non-small cell lung cancer, with the latter being more prevalent. Subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer include squamous cell, large cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and rarer types like pleomorphic, carcinoid tumor, salivary gland carcinoma, and unclassified carcinoma.

[NCI resources currently offer 70 Lung Cancer focused data sets](https://cbiit.github.io/ccdi-ods-content/pages/documents/data-spotlight-cancer-subtypes/Lung.xlsx). Additionally, other data sets are also available which include Lung Cancer data as part of larger studies encompassing many cancer subtypes.

### Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month

Pancreatic cancer starts in the pancreas cells, an abdominal organ located behind the stomach, which produces digestive enzymes and hormones like insulin for glucose regulation. It manifests in two forms: exocrine pancreatic cancer, constituting 95% of cases, and endocrine or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Risk factors include smoking, obesity, diabetes, chronic pancreatitis, and specific hereditary conditions. The National Cancer Institute's SEER Program estimates 64,050 new cases and around 50,550 deaths from pancreatic cancer in the US in 2023, ranking it as the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Projections suggest it might become the second leading cause by 2030, behind lung cancer. With a five-year survival rate of just 12.5 percent, pancreatic cancer remains highly lethal.

[NCI resources currently offer 24 Pancreatic Cancer focused data sets](https://cbiit.github.io/ccdi-ods-content/pages/documents/data-spotlight-cancer-subtypes/Pancreatic.xlsx).
